Early documentation and setup for self-hosted GitLab runners.

Documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/tutorials/create_register_first_runner/.

1. Extend `packer-infrastructure` to include Node.
2. Register that machine as a runner.
3. Now the machine can be picked up as a runner by the CI/CD script.
